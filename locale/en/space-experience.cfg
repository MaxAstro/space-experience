spx-rocket-telemetry-analyzer=Rocket telemetry analyzer

[entity-description]
spx-rocket-telemetry-analyzer=Analyzes rocket launches anywhere on the local planet, providing valuable data.\nMultiple analyzers per planet can analyze multiple launches at once, but don't make analyzing a single launch any faster.

spx-rocket-telemetry-analyzer=Rocket telemetry analyzer
spx-rocket-telemetry=Rocket telemetry
spx-analyzed-telemetry=Analyzed telemetry
spx-rocket-control-unit=Rocket control unit

spx-rocket-telemetry-analysis=Turns out going to space is hard! The [entity=spx-rocket-telemetry-analyzer] can provide valuable data, making it easier to contruct and launch rockets in the future.
spx-experienced-rocketry-1=With a few launches under our belt, we can develop better manufacturing processes for rockets. [recipe=spx-efficient-rocket-parts] uses fewer resources per rocket at a slightly slower crafting speed.
spx-experienced-rocketry-2=Flexibility is the name of the game. [recipe=spx-cheap-rocket-parts] are slow to manufacture but don't require many resources, while [recipe=expensive-rocket-parts] are just the opposite. Additionally, general process improvements increase rocket silo productivity by 25% regardless of recipe.
